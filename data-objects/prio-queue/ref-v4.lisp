;; CLONE is called when opening for write access.
;;
;; NOTE: These are all shallow (skeleton spine) copies Be careful not
;; to mutate any of the contained objects, but mutation of spine cells
;; is fine.  When operating on a clone, the use of single-thread
;; algorithms is fine. No other threads can see it.

;; COW semantics provide for shallow copies, which suit lists of
;; simple data, but not for lists which will undergo subsequent use as
;; a dictionary. Any modification of the dictionary mutates a second
;; level of data which has not been copied in a COW dereferencing.
;;
;; It is impossible to discern intention from the simple LIST
